# COVID-19
<br>
##Project Main Idea and goals
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which was originally detected at the end of 2019, has impacted almost every aspect of life as we know it, and that’s what makes it the most important topic in the topics which we are interested in studying their statistics. Thus, our project which is developed as GUI form using python language focuses on studying the impact of the disease on a few nations which are used as a sample to represent the impact of Covid-19 on the globe.
<br>
From our studies and from the graphs which represent the injuries, death and recovered in each sample country, we were able to calculate some of descriptive statistics like mean, mode, IQR, .... and so on
